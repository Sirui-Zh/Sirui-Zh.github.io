    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Financial Engineering at Cornell University and hold a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with a minor in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>My work blends financial pricing, quantitative research, and portfolio management. I have experience across trading strategies, risk modeling, and machine learning.</p>
    <p>Previously, I worked with BH Asset Management, BigQuant, and China Construction Bank, where I developed return trend prediction models, automated data integration, optimized traditional strategy, generated sentiment factors, and built risk frameworks for energy and financial markets.</p>
    <p>I have also conducted research on large language models in bond pricing, mortgage prepayment prediction, and enhanced Markowitz optimization.</p>
